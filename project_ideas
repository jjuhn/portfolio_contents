2. Bayesian modeling tutorial?
    - Dependent vs Independent sampling
        - independent sampling: limited to special cases, effective only in low dimensions, require special tailoring for efficiency(time consuming)
        - dependent sampling: wider variety of simulation methods, complex, high dimensional but requires more samples for a given accuracy
        
    - Markov chain explanation(what is the purpose? where it is used?
    - MCMC explanation
        - Gibbs Sampling
        - Metropolis algorithms (simplify with example) 
        - Metropolis Hastings
    - Practical MCMC in R.
        - JAGS(DAGS)
        - Decisions: how many chains?, starting point?, converged?, transient?, which iterates to use?, how many iterates do we need?
            - run several independent chains from different sparse starting points(3 to 5 chains)
            - overdispersed starting point is much better: multiple modes detection is easier, so as convergence diagnostics 
            - in hierarchical model, only the top level hyperparameter should be initialized
            - automatic tuning: **Adaptation**, use the tuning but discard the initial run 
            - convergence: the good chain = posterior is the limiting distribution
3. Check out datastudio by google for visualization project 
    - what to visualize? maybe some sort of data science related algorithms. apriori?
4. Linear Regression using R (DONE, house price prediction project)
5. Linear Regression using R in MCMC approach. 
6. What is the difference? Which is better? 
7. About Kaggle Competition: 
8. List of possible interview questions
9. Personal Diary about my gap year: study, things I did, parenting etc.
