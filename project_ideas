2. Bayesian modeling tutorial?
    - Markov chain explanation(what is the purpose? where it is used?)
    - MCMC explanation
        - Gibbs Sampling
        - Metropolis algorithms (simplify with example) 
        - Metropolis Hastings
    - Practical MCMC in R.
        - JAGS(DAGS)
        - Decisions: how many chains?, starting point?, converged?, transient?, which iterates to use?, how many iterates do we need?
            - run several independent chains from different sparse starting points(3 to 5 chains)
            - overdispersed starting point is much better: multiple modes detection is easier, so as convergence diagnostics 
            - in hierarchical model, only the top level hyperparameter should be initialized
            - automatic tuning: **Adaptation**, use the tuning but discard the initial run 
            - convergence: the good chain = posterior is the limiting distribution
